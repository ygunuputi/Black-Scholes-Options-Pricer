This project provides a Python implementation of the Black-Scholes model to calculate the theoretical price of European call and put options.

It uses a BlackScholes class that takes the underlying asset price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free interest rate, and volatility as inputs.

The program contains methods to calculate the d1 and d2 values, which are then used to determine the fair market value of both call and put options based on the established financial formulas.

This tool is useful for anyone looking to understand or apply the Black-Scholes framework for options pricing.
